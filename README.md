Problem Description  
1. Implementing Linked Lists:  
o Implement singly linked lists with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal. o  
doubly linked lists with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
o Implement circular linked lists with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
2. Applications:  
o Postfix Calculator: Implement a stack-based solution for evaluating postfix expressions.  
o Queue-Based System Simulation: Simulate a queue-based ticketing system.  
Implement 
o Priority Queue Using Heaps: Implement a priority queue using a heap data structure. Instructions  
1. Linked List Implementation:  
o Create classes SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, and CircularLinkedList.  
o Each class should have methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.  
2. Postfix Calculator:  
 
 
 
o Write a class PostfixCalculator that evaluates postfix expressions using a stack.  
3. Queue-Based Ticketing System:  
o Write a class TicketQueue that simulates a ticketing system using a queue. Include methods to add 
tickets to the queue and to process them.  
4. Priority Queue Implementation:  
o Write a class PriorityQueue that uses a heap to manage elements based on their priority.
